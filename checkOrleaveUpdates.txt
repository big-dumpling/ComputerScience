captains log~~

oh yeah this works lol
"this page has recieved too many requests" lol excuse me for working
yea i just got that too
thats jusdfksjsjdkfdsjg.fsdnj,gh,wsdhmfb,msndbf
oh i opened it in another window and its fine lol
did it show the folder in github
honestly im still trying to figure out how to export it lol
theres an export button then there's "user/repo" and im filling in my name and 
the branch
its just the share 
im pretty sure its just the link 
right lol
its not working i think im doing something wrong
did you copy it
yeah
it worked for me
oh it says my repo has to have at least one file in it already lol
in the tools you can export to github
right
ahhhhhh there we go lol
nice
lol are we never deleting the text?
idk was just gonna log it line 1
right lol its like a diary
hmmm
welp we can start making our games not
ignore that typo please i hope you didnt see it lol
you probably didnt and i brought light to it whoops
oops lol
wow sarts welp thats a new one
oops i sarted exqueeze me
i mean thats always fun smooch smooch
welp time to flee~
lol nyoooom
I MUÂ§T FLEE
wow special characters
wish i were that cool
yes yes special charz
no you dont
its too powerful for mortal mens' brains
it is destroying my body
i must....
i must.......
flee
amazing
indeed
alright are we gonna code some more or no lol
i dont know il prob play ing p5 trying to get stuff to work
like games
stuff like what?
make sure instead of defining variable like:
  let x = 0;
say:
  this.x = 0;
since the game is an object the variables need to be properties, it might be a little funky using p5 and not the engine we made
im not to worried about that button stuff its the getting it to work right part if it works in p5 it should work here
i mean since we use a Game class to create games you would need to copy the class into p5 because they work differently
unless you want to make the game normally in p5 and when you transfer it to here, you can rename the variables from x to this.x
i would type those in p5
ok are you going to copy the class?
yea
ok cool, you can do it in here too lol or do you use p5 because of that too many requests thing? or maybe the splitscreen
i was going to use p5 cuz it tells me where the error is
its like its own gradle build
but i guess it would work here
nice
69 lines ... nice
are you using p5 because the code is native to the site? like the syntax errors?
yea if i did a call wrong here i wouldnt be able to tell because most functions set off the " this isnt a thing" alarm
oh that red dot thing lol this site is interesting but my only complaint is the 
false syntax errors
wait maybe not
i was gonna say a flaw with my game class, how would i do functions? since you make those outside of setup() and draw() -- the only two functions p5 has that i put into the class
but i remembered i can do this.jump = function(height){//stuff();}
with objects like everything is a variable and thats why i love javascript its so versatile and flexible
unlike java where a variable is strictly int, boolean, string, string[], int[], stuff like that
o the live crashed again
aaaaand its back
oh did you lag?
its my house

i lagged whoops 
maybe make it an ellipse and make presets as buttons
make the button an ellipse?
presets of what?
no like the dot in painter yea
oh like a brush tool?
it can be whatever you want, i was just testing my class to see if it worked
i might go to bed soon
i can try to organize for a bit kinda plan stuff out
organize what?
oh ok like game ideas? or menu pretty-ups?
ive been asking people what we should make game-wise but havent gotten that many replies
something i find amazing is omniscient-memory.glitch.me can be shared with anyone you have talked with so they can see the progress, like it's always running on their server
yea thats pretty cool
i typed the link on my phone and im like whaaaat
wait does touch act like mouseX and Y
oh yeah, you can draw on your phone with the program
im loving this lol
o thats nice
fun fact: ive always wanted to make games since i was really little lol
like maybe 7? or 8*
`-` you saw n0thing
it has fled
the main reason i got intocode was cuz i wanted to make them
im glad its called omniscient memory lol im happy it wasnt a crappy name
right ive always wanted to make some kind of game anyway i want
i just realized i didnt have to sign in again when i got home
are you on your chromebook?
oh you mustve saved your login
yea 
nope
hmmmmmmmmmmm you sure?
i dont trust google enough
and its a school computer

flee-ers diary~~
Which program are you talking about? I was thinking a painter because colors, but then I'm thinking about your saxophone hero because you said note
both sax hero and p5 hero
I kinda got it working but the note isnt being displayed

You won't see me at school tomorrow because I have some doctors appointment stuffz
ok
what did you do for your notes in your trumpet version?
-------------------------------------------------------
3/4/19
(insert funny name/title)
i actually haven't worked on that yet. All I have so far is the buttons and things lighting up, and a framework for the notes. and something to play the sound

this is what i have so far
1 2 3 4 5 for presing down notes and ^ and v for strums
